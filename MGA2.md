**_1._** A bird is flying along the straight line 2y−6x=34. In the same plane, an aero plane starts to fly in a straight line and passes through the point (4,12). Consider the point where aero plane starts to fly as origin. If the bird and plane collides then enter the answer as 1 and if not then 0. Note: Bird and aero plane can be considered to be of negligible size.

**_2._** A rock is thrown in a pond, and creates circular ripples whose radius increases at a rate of 0.2 meter per second. What will be the value of Aπ​, where A is the area (in square meter) of the circle after 5 seconds? Hint: The area of a circle πr2, where r is the radius of the circle.

**_4._** A line l is such that its segment between the lines x−y+2=0 and x+y−1=0 is internally bisected at the point (1,1.5). What is the equation of the line l?

- [ ]  x+2y=1

- [ ]  x−2y=3

- [ ]  y=3x

- [x] x=1

**5.** Let ABCD be a parallelogram with vertices A(x1,y1), B(x2,y2), and C(x3,y3). Which of the following always denotes the coordinate of the fourth vertex D?

- [ ]  (x1+x2+x3,y1+y2+y3)

- [x] (x1−x2+x3,y1−y2+y3)

- [ ] (x1+x2−x3,y1+y2−y3)

- [ ] (x1−x2−x3,y1−y2−y3)

**_6._** A line perpendicular to the line segment joining the points A(1,0) and B(2,3), divides it at C in the ratio of 1:3. Then the equation of the line is

- [ ] 2x+6y−9=0

- [x] 2x+6y−7=0

- [ ] 2x−6y−9=0

- [ ] 2x−6y+7=0

**\*_7\\. (1 point)_\*** A mobile company wants to launch its new model in collaboration with a network provider named Astron to attract more customers. The following are two options the mobile company gives to buy the mobile.

\- Option 1 - Mobile and 1-year Astron Network costs 34000 rupees (Network offers unlimited calls for one year)

\- Option 2 - Only Mobile costs 22000 rupees

Now Lalith wants to buy this new model mobile. Lalith needs only 200 minutes per month. There are two network providers in the country.

The extracted text from the image is:

| Network Provider | Fixed Charge (Per month) | Per minute Charge |

|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|

| Astron           | 100                      | 2                 |

| Proton           | 200                      | 0\\.5              |

How much will he save per year if he chooses the best option to buy the mobile compared to the collaborated offer given by the company?

**_8._** The total expenses of mess consists of fixed cost and the variable cost, Variable cost is proportional to the number of inmates of the mess, The total expenses are 16000 rupees when 12 members in the mess, and 20000 rupees when 20 members in the mess, find the Fixed cost of the mess.

**_9._**  The equation used to measure the Cd (discharge coefficient) of the venturi meter value in the lab is:

\\\[Q = \\\\frac{c_d}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^4}}\\\\sqrt{2g\\\\Delta h}\\\]

\- cd– discharge coefficient

\- β– d/D

\- A1– Pipe section

\- A2– Restriction area

\- Δh– head losses

\- Q– flow rate

Ramesh plotted the graph between Q on the y-axis and √Δh on the x-axis and claimed that \\\[\\\\frac{c\\\_{d}}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^{4}}}\\\\sqrt{2g}\\\] is the slope of the obtained straight line.

Suresh plotted the graph between √Δh on the y-axis and Q on the x-axis and claimed that \\\[\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^{4}}}{c\\\_{d}\\\\sqrt{2g}}\\\] is the slope of the straight line.

Who is/are actually correct?

- [ ] \- Only Ramesh

- [ ] \- Only Suresh

- [x] \- Both Ramesh and Suresh

- [ ] \- None of them are correct

**10.** A fitness trainer is analyzing the weight loss progress of his best client over a period of 6 months, to use it as for marketing. He recorded the weight of the client at the beginning and end of each month. Using straight line fitting, he came up with an equation W=−8t+98W=−8t+98, where W = Weight in Kg, t= time in months.

Now you want to check weather this equation is correct or not so you collected the data from the gym, the data is given in table below.

| Time (months) | Weight (Kgs) |

|---------------|--------------|

| 0             | 98           |

| 1             | 90           |

| 2             | 82           |

| 3             | 74           |

| 4             | 66           |

| 5             | 57           |

| 6             | 49           |

You were impressed by the performance of the fitness trainer, so you want to get trained under him, you assumed that the rate of weight loss (weight loss per month) will be same as the case of the best client mentioned in the question. Considering your assumption is true, how many days are required for you to loss weight from 100 kg to 72 kg.

Note: 1 month has 30 days
