- [ ] g has two turning points and y-coordinate of only one turning point is negative.

- [ ] g has two turning points and there are no turning points with negative y-coordinate.

- [ ] f has two turning points and y-coordinate of only one turning point is negative.

- [ ] f is strictly decreasing in \[10, ∞).
