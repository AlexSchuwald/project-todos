### Let f: R→R and g: R→R be two functions, defined as f(x) = x^3 - 8x^2 + 7 and g(x) = -2f(x) respectively. Choose the correct option(s) from the following.

- [ ] g has two turning points and y-coordinate of only one turning point is negative.

- [ ] g has two turning points and there are no turning points with negative y-coordinate.

- [ ] f has two turning points and y-coordinate of only one turning point is negative.

- [ ] f is strictly decreasing in \[10, ∞).

### Which among the following function first increases and then decreases in all the intervals (-4, -3) and (-1, 2) and (5, 6)?

- [ ] \-\\frac{1}{10000}(x+1)^2(x-2)(x+3)^2(x+4)^2(5-x)^2(x-6)^2(3-x)

- [ ] \\frac{1}{10000}(x+1)^2(x-2)(x+3)(x+4)(x-5)^2(x-6)^2

- [ ] \\frac{1}{10000}(x+1)^2(x-2)(x+3)(x+4)(x-5)^2(x-6)^2(x+7)

- [ ] \-\\frac{1}{1000}(x+1)^2(x-2)(x+3)^2(x+4)(5-x)(x-6)^2

### Consider a polynomial function p(x) = -(x²-16)(x-3)²(2-x)²(x+9). Choose the set of correct options.

- [ ] p(x) is strictly increasing when x ∈ (4, ∞)

- [ ] p(x) is strictly decreasing when x ∈ (-∞, -9)

- [ ] Total number of turning points of p(x) are 6.

- [ ] Total number of turning points of p(x) are 7.

### An ant named B, wants to climb an uneven cliff and reach its anthill (i.e., home of ant). On its way home, B makes sure that it collects some food. A group of ants have reached the food locations which are at x-intercepts of the function f(x) = -(x²-19)((x-9)³-1). As ants secrete pheromones (a form of signals which other ants can detect and reach the food location), B gets to know the food location. Then the sum of the coordinates of all the food locations is?
