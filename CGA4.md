1\. What will `A` represent at the end of the execution of the following pseudocode using the “Words” dataset?

`A = 0`

`while Table1.hasmore_rows():`

`    X = Table1.readtop_row()`

`    i = 1`

`    B = False`

`    while i <= X.LetterCount:`

`        if X.word[i - 1] in "aeiou":`

`            B = True`

`        i += 1`

`    if B:`

`        A += 1`

`    Table_2.move(X)/`
